# MeshGeodesy
Contains application and library for geodesic distance and path computation over triangle meshes. 
The code is mainly composed by:
* mgapp: Appication code that launches an XWindows to render mesh and its geodesic distance and path information through OpenGL.
* mglib: Library code that reads in a triangle mesh from file, and outputs geodesic distance and path of a selected vertex to all other vertices in the triangle mesh.
